# Problem Statement:
# We've written a helper function for you called greet(name) which takes as input a string name and prints a greeting. Write some code in main() to get the user's name and then greet them, being sure to call the greet(name) helper function.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# What's your name? Sophia

# Greetings Sophia!


def greet():
    users_name = input("\nWhat's your name? ")
    print(f"Greetings {users_name}")

greet()  

# output:

# What's your name? Mueza Ejaz!
# Greetings Mueza Ejaz!
