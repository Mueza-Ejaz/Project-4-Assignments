# Problem Statement:
# Fill out the double(num) function to return the result of multiplying num by 2. We've written a main() function for you which asks the user for a number, calls your code for double(num) , and prints the result.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input in bold italics):

# Enter a number: 2 Double that is 4



def double_num():
    user = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    double_val = user * 2
    print(f"Double that is: {double_val}")

double_num()

# output1:

# Enter a number: 4
# Double that is: 8

# output2:

# Enter a number: 2
# Double that is: 4

# output3:

# Enter a number: 8
# Double that is: 16
